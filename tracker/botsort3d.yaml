# BoT-SORT 3D Tracker Configuration
# All distance thresholds are in normalized range [0, 1] where 1.0 ≈ 2m in 3D space

# --- Detection Filtering ---
track_high_thresh: 0.5    # Min confidence for first-pass association
track_low_thresh: 0.1     # Min confidence for second-pass (low-conf recovery)
new_track_thresh: 0.6     # Min confidence to initialize a new track

# --- Association ---
match_thresh: 0.4          # First-pass matching threshold (normalized; 0.4 ≈ 0.8m)
second_match_thresh: 0.25  # Second-pass threshold (low-conf detections; 0.25 ≈ 0.5m)
unconfirmed_thresh: 0.35   # Third-pass threshold (unconfirmed tracks; 0.35 ≈ 0.7m)

# --- Track Lifecycle ---
track_buffer: 10           # Frames to keep lost track before removal

# --- ReID / Appearance ---
with_reid: true            # Enable appearance embedding for anti-swap
proximity_thresh: 0.5      # Don't use appearance if position cost > this
appearance_thresh: 0.25    # Reject appearance match if embedding dist > this
model: "auto"              # ReID model ("auto" = YOLO native features)

# --- Legacy (required by parent class but unused in 3D) ---
